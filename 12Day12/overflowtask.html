          London is the capital and largest city of England and the United
          Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.[1] It stands on
          the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80
          km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for
          two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial
          centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its
          medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of Westminster, to the west
          of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national
          government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[11] the name
          "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core,
          historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey,
          Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised
          Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the
          Greater London Authority.[note 2][14] As one of the world's major
          global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on its arts,
          entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care,
          media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and
          communications.[16][17] Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the
          largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it is one of the major
          financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of
          higher education institutions,[19] it is home to some of the
          highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College
          London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics
          in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College
          London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the
          busiest city airport system in the world.[22] The London Underground
          is the oldest rapid transit system in the world

        Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most
        populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423
        residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi),[5] making
        it the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2020.[6] Since
        the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of
        finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its
        leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system
        of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as "the City of
        Light".[7] Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also
        sometimes called the capital of the world. The City of Paris is the
        centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an estimated
        population of 12,262,544 in 2019, or about 19% of the population of
        France,[8] making the region France's primate city. The Paris Region had
        a GDP of €739 billion ($743 billion) in 2019, which is the highest in
        Europe.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost
        of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest
        cost of living in the world.[10] Paris is a major railway, highway, and
        air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de
        Gaulle Airport (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly
        Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris
        Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the
        second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du
        Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest
        located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015

          India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25]
          is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area,
          the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
          the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea
          on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares
          land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to
          the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian
          Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its
          Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
          Myanmar, and Indonesia. Modern humans arrived on the Indian
          subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28]
          Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as
          hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to
          Africa in human genetic diversity.[29] Settled life emerged on the
          subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000
          years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of
          the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of
          Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
          northwest.[31][32] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the
          Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the
          Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[33] The Dravidian
          languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
          regions.[34] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
          emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen,
          proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political
          consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires
          based in the Ganges Basin.[37] Their collective era was suffused with
          wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the declining status
          of women,[39] and the incorporation of untouchability into an
          organised system of belief.[g][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms
          exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the
          kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]

          India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25]
          is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area,
          the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
          the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea
          on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares
          land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to
          the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian
          Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its
          Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
          Myanmar, and Indonesia. Modern humans arrived on the Indian
          subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28]
          Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as
          hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to
          Africa in human genetic diversity.[29] Settled life emerged on the
          subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000
          years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of
          the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of
          Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
          northwest.[31][32] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the
          Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the
          Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[33] The Dravidian
          languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
          regions.[34] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
          emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen,
          proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political
          consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires
          based in the Ganges Basin.[37] Their collective era was suffused with
          wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the declining status
          of women,[39] and the incorporation of untouchability into an
          organised system of belief.[g][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms
          exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the
          kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]
